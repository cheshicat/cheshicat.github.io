The past year has not been the easiest. Coming into a remote program, part-time, with life often getting in the way is challenging, It's even scarier if, like me, this world is completely new to you. There were many times I felt doubtful I'd ever complete a lab, or a section, with confidence. Finishing this course sometimes seemed impossible. 

It was not until I *truly* realized what Flatiron had been trying to tell me since day one - this was not a traditional learning experience with memorization and testing, but something where we learned to *do* things. And so eventually, it became clear that I had the tools to solve these problems all along. 

But sometimes, you need to look beyond your coursework and into your habits, to figure out how to win a challenge. So here are my tips for programming yourself out of frustration and into a winning streak!

1. **Take a breather**. Frustration kills creativity. Step away from the computer when you find yourself blocked.
2. **Boost your confidence**. When you feel defeated, you need to get your confidence up again. It can be anything from working on a different section you find easier, to attending a work-out class, to cleaning those dishes you've been ignoring. Choose a task you know you can complete to remember that you aren't defeated so easily.
3. **Google**. Google it! Someone else has done this before, and you might learn some new ways of approahing a problem.
4. **Phone a friend**. Ask another student, or a friend who is a fellow programmer, or an instructor to look over your code. Sometimes a pair of fresh eyes is all you need.
5. **Go to review sessions**. If you don't feel like you have a full grasp on the subject, it can only help.
6. **Never give up!** Sometimes a lab might take you days. That's okay. Do a little bit of something each day and eventually you will figure it out!
