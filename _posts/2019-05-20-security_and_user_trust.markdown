After learning about BCrypt and watching both Ari's video and the linked YouTube channel about ways you definitely do *not* want to store passwords, I found myself getting annoyed at all the times my data has been leaked by companies who I am now more certain than ever ranged from careless to inexcusably negligent in how they handle user data.

Unfortunately, like too many people these days, I've experienced first hand the effects of a major data breach, from major effects like identity theft to small annoyances like an incredible amount of spam emails from disreputable actors. And from sites big and small I've had passwords leaked (thankfully, years later and I know better than to keep reusing!) Knowing how innappropriate it is now to have user's passwords stored in plain text, or behind a very basic encryption key, and how easy it would have been for these sites to have been more responsible, just makes me angry all over again!

It seems that even in 2019, living in a world where the web is just as integral to our lives as electricity, many people still have issues taking anything 'online' seriously. While I get the adjustment is difficult for those in generations ahead of mine, many of these people are in real positions of power and we are way past the point that you can excuse any person whose ignorance can have a real material effect on people's lives. What happens online is not confined to a virtual alt-reality; it is real life. We should find it just as offensive and inappropriate for companies to play fast and loose with security as we would any random stranger you'd meet physically who takes your wallet and leaves it in the middle of Penn Station at rush hour. 

We want our users to like what we make, to enjoy our apps, and to trust us to be responsible. And we owe it to ourselves to build and create things that make the world better, not worse! Don't break your user's trust, and the world is a much happier place.
