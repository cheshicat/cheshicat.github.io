One of the more interesting parts of my journey into code is learning that things I thought were trivial amusements from my younger years were actually useful tools. Just like learning English, I didn't realize how useful those tools were when I learned to use them - they were just necessary, at the time.

Most people my age grew up with an early form of the web. We talked on AIM, and were the first adopters of early social networks like MySpace and LiveJournal. Back then, it was all about customizing - your profile, your away message, your top 8 and annoying autostart song where all important facets of how you displayed your personality to everyone online. It was not just the way you communicated but your presentation that became important. Just like HTML & CSS is crucial to our appearance today, so too were they back then!

What struck me about this was not just the pleasure of, in a way, being reintroduced to these old friends in a new and improved way than just editing skins for my preteen journal. It was the regret I felt that as children and preteens and teenagers, I can't remember anyone taking the creativity and self-learning of myself and my girlfriends as anything more than something trivial, shallow even- including, until recently, myself. What could have been a gateway to get a whole generation learning to go deeper with something they enjoyed was written off as a silly teenage girl hobby. I imagine there are many women now who will never find there way back to this fun and exciting world because no one took them seriously at a formative time.

This is why what we do is so important. Being given this opportunity through the Flatiron School and Women take Tech is just one of many ways this industry has begun to remedy the mistakes of the past. Tech is all about moving forward by solving problems and creating better ways to do what we did in the past. The concepts I have learned in this course continue to turn out lessons more universal than I ever expected. I am happy to reintroduce myself to HTML & CSS, and even happier to be a positive contributor to an exciting and evolving industry.
