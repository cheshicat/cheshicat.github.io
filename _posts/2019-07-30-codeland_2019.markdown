Codeland 2019 was my first real "coding conference". It really reinvigorated me and helped me feel more confident about this journey!

Other than learning some useful skills in a Github workshop and getting to hear about some really interesting projects, I met so many amazing people (including some recent Flatiron grads!). But what really interested me were two themes that kept repeating over and over:

1) Programming is so much more than just the stereotype! It's problem solving and creative thinking, and working with others to get a final result. The applications of what we learn are way further reaching than anyone would initially think of!

2) Don't wait for others to solve a problem. It's okay to break rules that are set in place by greedy people when you're working together to legitemately make the world a better place. And following that notion, open source projects are incredible for enabling us to do this.

The attitude was refreshing and positive, and it was so cool to see so many different types of people at different stages in their journey in tech!
