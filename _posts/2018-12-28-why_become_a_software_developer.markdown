My choice of career has zigged and zagged since before even declaring my first academic track in undergrad. As someone whose main problem in life seems to be having too many interests, it has long been a struggle to find the right career path. And the most consistent issue has always been that while I *liked* many things and can do many things *well*, I don't love them, and can't imagine being stuck doing just *one* thing my entire life. So what's a person like me to do?

Initially, it was to try any and every opportunity, and in early adult years I did exactly that to an almost comical degree. Like a prince in a fairytale searching for their one true love, I went on a journey, and each step gave me tools to better understand the world around me, and evaluate both the paths open to me and my internal wants and needs. 

Getting to know myself better enabled me to identify the things I liked that were similar regardless of industry or subject matter. Things like research, continuing my education, solving puzzles and interesting problems, learning languages, learning new skills and really using them, seeing the effects of my work in the real world, collaborating with others, being creative, and the freedom to self-direct my work were all consistent. A chance encounter with javascript was my first hint that coding was all of that and more, and the later realization that I actually knew more about programming languages than I realized opened this path to me. When I had a chance to switch career tracks through the Flatiron School, it was a no-brainer, and as I've been learning I am only more convinced this is the right decision.
